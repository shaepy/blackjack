            <p>It's you versus the Dealer. Your goal is to get as close to 21 as you can without going over. </p>
            <p>Both of you start with two cards. The dealer will show one card face up, and one face down.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cards 2-10 are worth their number</li>
                <li>Face (J, Q, K) cards are worth 10</li>
                <li>Aces are flexible and can count as 11 or 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On your turn, you can <strong>Hit</strong> to draw another card, or <strong>Stand</strong> to hold your hand and end your turn.</p>
            <p>Once youâ€™re done, the dealer flips their hidden card and plays. They have to keep hitting until they reach at least 17.</p>
            <p>Whoever is closer to 21 without going over wins.</p>
